select name salary age 
   from employees  emp
   inner join employee_projects empProj
       on emp.id = empProj.employee_id
   inner join projects
       on empProj.project_id = projects.project_id
       SUM(emp.salary)
       AVEG(emp.age)
   group by projects.project_name
   ordered by projects.project_name

We are joining on on project_id and the three tables hence I would make sure
that it is indexed. However, I suspect the number of rows on the projects is
not huge, so it would not matter too much. Indexing on employee_id in the
employees table would probably be the best choice.
